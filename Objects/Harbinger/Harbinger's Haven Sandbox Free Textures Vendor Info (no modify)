Harbinger's Haven Texture Vendor is organised into category boxes.

Touch the box of your choice to the left and the textures in that category will display in the main panel. From here you can:

+Touch Thumbs to see the textures in that box 16 at a time.

+Touch the Texture button  to see the selected texture displayed full size

+Touch the Tiles button to see the selected texture displayed in a tiled format (let's you see if it's seamless)

+Touch the Jump button to go to a wanted page- or texturenumber

+Touch the info button to receive a notecard on the textures on the organiser (this note)

+Touch the Menu button to receive a menu of options for that box -

            ~ Copy - sends you the selected texture 
           
             ~ Copy All - sends you folders in sets of 75 for that category
            
            ~ Text. UUID - says the texture UUID of the selected texture in open chat (for use in scripts)
            
The textures provided in the organisers at the tele in point have been collected from various freebie outlets over an extended period of time. Great efforts have been made to remove any duplication, however, it is possible a few have been missed due to the large number of textures involved.

Every reasonable effort has been made to ensure all of these textures are, in fact, freebies. Please IM me if you have issues.

Texture donations are greatly appreciated. If you wish to donate, add the texture to a notecard and place it in the notecard receiver near the teleport point. Full permissions are required for them to be added to the texture organisers.

Enjoy!

**Thank you to Jack Hathor who went out of his way to mod his texture organiser to suit our needs. It is very much appreciated.
