					<p>This was on sale as the BijoCam Constructions System for a
						while, and did surprisingly well (for something I originally
						developed while I was just experimenting with the then-new camera
						commands in LSL!) but since I found the vendor network for BijoCam
						collapsed ages ago and I expect people are moved on to much more
						wonderful things anyway, here's the source code for the BijoCam.
						Feel free to use and have fun with it.</p>

					<p>
						<tt> Hello, and thanks for purchasing the BijoCam Camera
							Control Kit! This document is intended to help you get started
							with the Bijocam System as quickly and easily as possible. It'll
							help to read through it before you start playing too much with
							the bits, though.&nbsp;:) </tt>
					</p>
					<p>
						<tt>USING BIJOCAM FOR JUST YOURSELF </tt>
					</p>
					<p>
						<tt>The FIRST thing to do is to take out the "BijoCam
							Interface" from the kit and WEAR it. You won't see anything at
							first - don't worry, it's there so that other parts of the kit
							can activate it. By default it attaches to "HUD bottom", but you
							can attach it somewhere else on your HUD if you prefer (it does
							need to be *somewhere* on your HUD though). </tt>
					</p>
					<p>
						<tt>You can then begin setting up cameras by dropping them
							into the world. </tt>
					</p>
					<p>
						<tt>VIEWING A CAMERA: To look through a camera, click on it
							and select "View", or, if you have given the camera a name (see
							below) you can view it by entering "/202 thename" or "/202
							thename view" (replacing "thename" with the name you gave the
							camera, of course.) If it's the first time you've ever done this,
							you will be asked to give permission for your camera to be
							controlled, and then your view will switch to the camera. To
							release the camera, click the "release camera" button. </tt>
					</p>
					<tt>
						<ul>
							<li><ul>
									<li>IMPORTANT NOTE: ** If you, the user, have moved the SL
										camera for some reason (for example, by using "Build", or by
										using Alt-look, or similar) then YOUR movement of the SL
										camera overrides BijoCam, so nothing will seem to happen when
										you click "View". Giving permission to control the camera
										makes no difference in this case - it is coded into SL that,
										if you have manually moved the camera to a particular place,
										nothing can override you. To fix this, click on the main SL
										Window and press ESCAPE - this cancels any user-applied camera
										movement and allows BijoCam to control the camera.</li>
								</ul></li>
						</ul>
						<p>VIEWING SEVERAL CAMERAS: If you have given several cameras
							names, you can set up a cycle by entering "/202
							name1,name2,name3" where name1, name2, name3 are the names of the
							cameras you set up. After giving permission (if necessary), you
							will be shown the view through the first camera, and you can then
							cycle between all the ones you named by clicking on the "next
							camera" button.</p>
						<p>GIVING A CAMERA A NAME: To give a camera a name, you can
							either rename it using the SL editor, or click on the camera and
							choose "Name" from the menu. It will prompt you to say "/202 "
							followed by the name you want. If the camera already has a name,
							you can change it by saying "/202 oldname name newname". If you
							give the camera a name using BOTH of the methods described (ie,
							changing the name in SL and using the name option in the menu),
							then it will respond to both names. Camera names must not contain
							spaces, and are not sensitive to case.</p>
						<p>CHOOSING WHERE A CAMERA POINTS: You can adjust the location
							and view of a camera in several different ways. The first is to
							just move and rotate it using the regular SL interface. The
							second way is to use the adjustment system. To do this, click on
							the camera and choose "Adjust" from the menu, or if you have
							given the camera a name, you can also type "/202 thename adjust".
						</p>
						<p>Once you do this, the camera will ask for permission to
							track your camera. Grant the permission, and then adjust your SL
							camera view to match where you want the camera to be. You can use
							any method available in SL - moving your avatar, using mouselook,
							and using alt-look. Once your screen is showing the view you want
							the camera to have, say "/202 ok", or (if you're in mouselook and
							can't chat) click the left mouse button. The camera will move to
							the appropriate position.</p>
						<p>HIDING AND SHOWING A CAMERA: To make a camera invisible,
							click on it and choose "Hide", or type "/202 thename hide". To
							make it visible again, click on it and choose "Show", or type
							"/202 thename show". You must give a camera a name before hiding
							it.</p>
						<p>REMOVING A CAMERA: You can delete cameras in the normal
							way. In addition, if a camera has a name, "/202 thename kill"
							will delete the camera.</p>
						<p>CLEANING UP CAMERAS: Saying "/202 camera cleanup" will
							delete all your cameras that don't have names. This is a way of
							cleaning up any cameras you've rezzed that have gotten lost
							before you could name them.</p>
						<p>VIEWING CAMERAS: Saying "/202 camera report" will show a
							list of all cameras in the area, their names and locations. Note
							that it shows the locations of ALL cameras, not just your own.</p>
						<p>USING BIJOCAM FOR OTHERS</p>
						<p>As well as setting up BijoCams for yourself to use, you can
							provide them for others too. In order to use your cameras,
							visitors will need a BijoCam Interface. (However, once they have
							one, it will work for every BijoCam in SL.) The interface is
							freely copyable, so you can give it to others, and a "dispenser
							panel" is also included that you can place on your land to allow
							others to obtain interfaces.</p>
						<p>CAMERAS: Anyone can click on a Camera object to look
							through it, or say "/202 thename" to look through it. If you
							don't want them to be able to do this, you can set the camera
							Private by clicking on it and selecting "Private" or entering
							"/202 thename private". (To undo this, click on the camera and
							select "Public", or say "/202 thename public".)</p>
						<p>CAMERA REPORT: Anyone can enter "/202 camera report" to
							view the names and locations of all cameras in the vicinity.
							Hiding a camera, or making it private, will not prevent it from
							showing up in this report - this is deliberate to prevent
							eavesdropping.</p>
						<p>USING SENSOR FIELDS</p>
						<p>The sensor fields allow you to build an environment that
							behaves as a traditional 3D game - where, as the player explores,
							the camera moves to particular places determined by the builder.
							Effectively, the sensor field lets you change the user's view to
							look through a particular camera when they pass through it. Note
							that, as always with BijoCam, the user can always release your
							control over their camera or revoke permission for the camera to
							be controlled.</p>
						<p>There are two types of field: sensor fields (red/blue), and
							permission fields (green). FIELDS CAN'T BE CLICKED ON (this
							prevents them creating confusing displays when they're invisible
							within your build) - all fields can ONLY be addressed by talking
							on channel 202, and thus they MUST be given names when they are
							created. Every field starts with the name "new" - so when you rez
							a field, before you do anything else, say "/202 new name
							somethingelse". Otherwise you'll wind up with a build full of
							fields called "new" that you can't tell apart.</p>
						<p>Permission fields cause a camera control permission request
							to be sent to anyone walking through them. By themselves, they
							don't do anything to the camera. However, they're important
							because sensor fields DON'T ask permission to control the camera
							- they assume you already have permission, and if you don't, they
							won't work. So you MUST ensure that a user walks through a
							permission field before they walk through any sensor fields.</p>
						<p>All fields respond to "/202 thename hide", "/202 thename
							show", "/202 thename name newname", and "/202 thename kill" in
							the same way that cameras do.</p>
						<p>Permission fields don't require any extra setting up: just
							rez them, name them, put them in the appropriate place and hide
							them, and you're done. Sensor fields, however, have to be set up
							to specify which cameras the user's view should be transferred to
							when the user walks through them. You do this with the commands
							"/202 thename redside cameraname", and "/202 thename blueside
							cameraname". "/202 thename redside cameraname" will cause the
							user's view to be switched to the camera named "cameraname" when
							they walk through the field onto the red-coloured side.
							Specifying "/202 thename redside release" will cause the camera
							to be released when the user walks through the field in that
							direction. "/202 thename blueside cameraname" and "/202 thename
							blueside release" do the same for when the user walks through in
							the other direction, towards the blue-coloured side.</p>
						<p>If you want to offer the user the choice of several
							cameras, you can do this in the same way you did when you were
							viewing them: "/202 thename redside name1,name2,name3,name4..".
							In this case, the user's view will start at name1, but they will
							have the "next camera" button available to switch between views.
						</p>
						<p>TECHY STUFF</p>
						<p>The script in the cameras can be removed and placed into
							other objects to cause them to act like cameras. The camera
							position is set to the centre of the camera object and the camera
							is pointed in the positive direction of the object's Z axis.</p>
						<p>Fields use Volume Detect sensing to avoid lagging the
							server with a repeated llSensor call. They detect the Av as it
							*leaves* the field - so be careful if you make the field any
							deeper than it is to start with. Also notice that the red and
							blue sides are detected based on the object's local coordinate
							system, not based on the colours of the textures, so changing the
							colour of parts of the object won't change its sensor properties.
							Although the fields are quite large by default, in fact as long
							as some part of the avatar touches some part of the field the
							avatar will be detected - so if you want to shrink them down into
							"tripwires", you can do so.</p>

					<h2>
						<span class="mw-headline">Interface Object</span>
					</h2>
					<p>This should be placed in an object to be worn on the HUD. It
						should be a 3-prim object where the 3 prims are buttons, labeled
						in turn: "Next Camera", "Release Camera", and "Revoke Permission"
						and in that order in the linkset. In the original they were just
						rectangles with very plain textures.</p>
					<p>A little note about the protocol used here: the first
						version of BijoCam went through a full permission request-response
						cycle every time a camera was activated, which was silly, because
						I was silly at the time. The current version handles all
						permissions on the client. This is why the redundant response to
						the "request" message is still in this script - for backward
						compatibility with older cameras.</p>

					<h2>
						<span class="mw-headline">Sensor Field</span>
					</h2>
					<p>This is used if you want to create a game-style moving
						camera. It detects an avie passing through it and sends a command
						to activate a nearby camera.</p>
					<p>The older versions of BijoCam also had "permission fields"
						which requested camera permission as you entered an area. The
						newer versions don't need them and they were only included in the
						kits for backwards compatibility.</p>
					<p>The prim for this needs to be a box of no thickness with one
						side red and one side blue. The size doesn't matter as long as the
						avie will pass through it at the point where you want the camera
						to change - I usually used a large doorway-style size, but I'm
						assured that tripwire size will work OK.</p>

					<p>The above script lets the sitter cycle through cameras by
						pressing the left and right arrows, but you can also allow them to
						cycle by pressing left and right on a HUD. But they don't need to
						wear the HUD! This script should go in a separate object with two
						prims for the left and right arrows. If it's present when the
						above script is used, it will position itself in the avie's camera
						view to look like a HUD even though it's an object in the world.</p>
